## Version 1.0.0
### Conditional Visibility
* Breaking: Option `skipAnimations` has been removed. To force re-evaluation of visibilities without animation (e.g. after the DOM has been modified), use `$(...).trigger("setVisibilities")` instead (this is already done automatically on `pageready`.)
* New option `animate`: Use `$(...).conditionalVisibility({animate: false})` if you want conditional visibility to work completely without animations.


## Version 0.2.0
* Add $.fn.numericValue().

### Conditional Visibility
* Make events triggering visibility re-calculation customizable.
* After an element is shown / hidden, a `shown.conditionalVisibility` / `hidden.conditionalVisibility` event is triggered. 


## Version 0.1.0
* Add $.fn.conditionalVisibility().
* Now requires CoffeeScript.


## Version 0.0.2
* Now supports forms generated by Formtastic.
* Return 'this' from formChangeTracker() to make it chainable.


## Version 0.0.1
